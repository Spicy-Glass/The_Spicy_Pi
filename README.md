# The Spicy Pi
This is the hardware for the capstone project, Spicy glass. This simiulates the app interacting with the car and altering aspects of the car.  As well, it simulates the hardware alterations affecting the app.

# Getting Started and Prerequisites
First you will have to have a raspeberry pi ready to go, and explanation of this can be found [here](https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/articles/set-up-raspberry-pi-4).

I personally used Putty [download link](https://www.google.com/search?q=putty&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS893US893&oq=putty&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l7.551j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), winSCP [download link](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php), and VNC [download link](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/) viewer but you can set it up however you like.

You will need python 3.7 [link here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) and up to run this program,
Next you will need to download all the libaraies from the requiered.txt.

Finally you will need to set up the hardware as specified [here] (https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=127005).

# Installing

Fist thing you need to do is to connect to the raspberry pi.  Once done, you will need to run the main.py file.  This will pop up a simple screen and you'll see the text.
```

```
Now that the program is running.  You can now click on the button.
When you hit the button the program will state
```
```
And the screen will show that the front defrost has been either turned on or off.
